# ROSTutorials

Hi there, 

I recently started working with ROS for the purpose of builidng a robotics project in the future, so for now I have 
been getting comfortable with it along with learning to navigate it as I do in Linux.

Downloading ROS Tutorial Packages for TurtleSim

I am running the Noetic version and using Ubuntu, so far the experience has been great as I configured NVIM to look 
as I wanted it and it now autocompletes, so my spelling mistakes don't appear so often. 

I decide to go with the C++ tutorials of ROS since I enjoy C++ more, but I do intend on seeing how Python programs with ROS.

Here are two tests of the turtle sim tutorials I ran, in which I learned how to launch the simulation and see connections between the nodes and packages.
