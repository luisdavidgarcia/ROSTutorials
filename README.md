# ROSTutorials

Hi there, 

I recently started working with ROS for the purpose of builidng a robotics project in the future, so for now I have 
been getting comfortable with it along with learning to navigate it as I do in Linux. 

I am running the Noetic version and using Ubuntu, so far the experience has been great as I configured NVIM to look 
as I wanted it and it now autocompletes, so my spelling mistakes don't appear so often. 

I decide to go with the C++ tutorials of ROS since I enjoy C++ more, but I do intent on seeing how Python programs with ROS.
